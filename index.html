          <h3>History of brand</h3>
          <p>
            The Henry Ford Company was Henry Ford's first attempt at a car manufacturing company and was established on November 3, 1901. This became the Cadillac Motor Company on August 22, 1902, after Ford left with the rights to his name.[18] 
            The Ford Motor Company was launched in a converted factory in 1903 with $28,000 (equivalent to $844,000 in 2021) in cash from twelve investors, most notably John and Horace Dodge (who would later found their own car company). 
          </p>
          <p>
            The first president was not Ford, but local banker John S. Gray, who was chosen in order to assuage investors' fears that Ford would leave the new company the way he had left its predecessor. During its early years, the company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on Mack Avenue and later at its factory on Piquette Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. 
            Groups of two or three men worked on each car, assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for Ford. Within a decade the company led the world in the expansion and refinement of the assembly line concept, and Ford soon brought much of the part production in-house

          <h3>Mondeo 4 and Fiesta 1.0</h3>
          <p>
            The Ford Mondeo is a large family car manufactured by Ford since 1993. The first Ford model declared as a "world car",[3][4] the Mondeo was intended to consolidate several Ford model lines worldwide (the European Sierra, the Telstar in Asia and Australia, and the Tempo/Mercury Topaz in North America). 
            The Mondeo nameplate is derived from the Latin word mundus, meaning "world".[5] Thus Mondeo can be viewed as a Latin-derived brandname from multiple languages: Bourguignon monde, English monde, Esperanto mondo, Franco-Provençal mondo, French monde, Friulian mond, Ido mondo, Istriot mondo, Italian mondo, Lombard mond, Occitan mond, Romansh (Surmiran dialect) mond, Venetian móndo, Walloon monde, all meaning "world". 
            For its first two generations, the Mondeo was produced using the CDW27 platform, with the third-generation model shifting to the EUCD platform. The fourth-generation models use the CD4 platform, and the fifth-generation use the C2 platform.
          </p>

            The Fiesta has always been brilliant to drive, and nothing has changed in that respect. 
            But a fantastic new engine and bold new styling mean it’s now also one of the most stylish, efficient and refined car in the class. Gadgets like the SYNC system and Active City Stop keep the Fiesta at the cutting edge of technology, and once again Ford has set a new benchmark for the rest of the class to follow. 
            It comes highly recommended.

            The 2023 Mustang Mach-E is available with either a standard-range 70.0-kWh battery or an extended-range 91.0-kWh pack. 
            These feed an electric motor mounted on the rear or both axles. 
            That latter combination creates all-wheel drive, and on the sporty GT and GT Performance models, the motors combine to make 480 horsepower and up to 634 pound-feet of torque. 
            Ford claims this will send the Mach-E GT Performance from zero to 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds. Less powerful models have 266 to 346 horsepower and 317 to 428 pound-feet of torque. 
            The Mach-E rides on wheels that range in size from 18 to 20 inches, and it can be had with adaptive dampers for adjustable ride firmness. 
            The earlier version we drove in 2021 was an extended-range all-wheel-drive model that was quick and better to drive than most ordinary crossovers. Drivers shouldn't expect the Mach-E to be nearly as engaging as the traditional Mustang. However, the Mach-E's quiet operation and super-smooth ride were most impressive.

            <h3>History of Brand</h3>
            <p>
              In 1924, Sakichi Toyoda invented the Toyoda Model G Automatic Loom. The principle of jidoka, which means the machine stops itself when a problem occurs, became later a part of the Toyota Production System. 
              Looms were built on a small production line. In 1929, the patent for the automatic loom was sold to the British company Platt Brothers,[4] generating the starting capital for automobile development.[5]
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the direction of the founder's son, Kiichiro Toyoda,[6][7] Toyoda Automatic Loom Works established an Automobile Division on September 1, 1933, and formally declared its intention to begin manufacturing automobiles on January 29, 1934.[6] 
              A prototype Toyota Type A engine was completed on September 25, 1934, with the company's first prototype sedan, the A1, completed the following May. As Kiichiro had limited experience with automobile production, he initially focused on truck production; the company's first truck, the G1, was completed on August 25, 1935, and debuted on November 21 in Tokyo, becoming the company's first production model.
              Modeled on a period Ford truck, the G1 sold for ¥2,900, ¥200 cheaper than the Ford truck. A total of 379 G1 trucks were ultimately produced.[8]

            <h3>Rav 4 and Camry</h3>
            <p>
              The Toyota RAV4 (Japanese: トヨタ・RAV4, Hepburn: Toyota Ravufō) is a compact crossover SUV produced by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Toyota. Considered the first ever compact crossover SUV,[1] it made its debut in Japan and Europe in 1994,[2] and in North America in 1995, being launched in January 1996.
              The vehicle was designed for consumers wanting a vehicle that had most of the benefits of SUVs, such as increased cargo room, higher visibility, and the option of full-time four-wheel drive, along with the manoeuvrability and fuel economy of a compact car. The vehicle's name is an abbreviation of "Recreational Active Vehicle with 4-wheel drive",
              or "Robust Accurate Vehicle with 4-wheel drive",[5] although not all models come equipped with the four-wheel drive system.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Toyota Camry (/ˈkæmri/; Japanese: トヨタ・カムリ Toyota Kamuri) is an automobile sold internationally by the Japanese auto manufacturer Toyota since 1982, spanning multiple generations. Originally compact in size (narrow-body), the Camry has grown since the 1990s to fit the mid-size classification (wide-body)—although the two widths co-existed in that decade. 
              Since the release of the wide-bodied versions, Camry has been extolled by Toyota as the firm's second "world car" after the Corolla. 
              As of 2022, the Camry is positioned above the Corolla and below the Avalon or Crown in several markets.

              The whole thing weighs 1,280kg, is good for 0-62mph in 5.5 seconds and a 143mph top end. In other words, it’s small, light and fast, eschewing the typical trend of gaining size and weight. Good.
              Toyota aimed to sell 750 when it launched in the UK in 2020, and it upped that target to 1,000 for 2021. Prices started at £30,020, and as you can read in the Buying section of this review the lease deals were very tempting too. 
              We use the past tense there because the GR was actually so successful that in July 2021 Toyota announced that every single car due to arrive in the UK up until 2023 had been sold. Boo. Still, when that news was announced it was at least possible to stick yourself on a waiting list - Toyota now says that due to 'unprecedented demand' the GR Yaris is completely unavailable to order.

              The BMW 1 Series sits towards the more expensive end of the family car category, closely mirroring the price of the Audi A3 and Mercedes A-Class. 
              Over three years, the 1 Series will hold on to a higher percentage of its cash price against depreciation than an equivalent A-Class, but the A3 has even stronger resale values.
            </p>

              BMW tends to offer some generous discounts, so make sure you check out the latest prices on our New Car Deals pages where you can find PCP finance quotes with any manufacturer bonuses. 
              The 1 Series is often cheaper per month than the A-Class.
